Project Overview

Purpose: 

Insight is a comprehensive full-stack news and blogging platform designed to empower writers and readers alike. Its main goal is to create a space where users can publish, explore, and interact with content from a wide range of categories—spanning technology, lifestyle, politics, education, entertainment, and more.
With a strong focus on usability, Insight offers a seamless editorial experience for writers through an intuitive and powerful rich-text editor. At the same time, readers benefit from a clean, organized, and customizable interface that allows them to filter content based on their interests.
This platform bridges the gap between professional journalism and community-driven blogs, encouraging open dialogue and diverse voices in a modern digital format.
